## Where to Download Game
Follow the Sync.com link. If that doesn't work download the files and in Unity create a new build

## Controls
WASD or Arrow keys to move

Left click to shoot


## Known Issues
- When you die, you have to alt + f4 the application since we ran out of time implementing the entirety of the game.
- Our main focus was trying to complete the main gameplay loop in the time that we had so we did not get enough time to add on polish of a menu and UI
